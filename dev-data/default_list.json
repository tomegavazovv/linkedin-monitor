This ICP is the most creative one, experiments a lot, has the highest churn (compared to sales teams, recruiters, or individuals), and has the most complex outbound stack.\n\nMost of the lead-gen agencies use 5+ different outbound tools (eg: Clay, Instantly.ai, Smartlead, Retention.com, Zapier, HighLevel, Apollo.io & some other wild animals that ColdIQ has on their site). Their outbound stack is integrated and works in perfect harmony. \n\nüîπ We understood that if we wanted to become a part of their outbound stack (become \"sticky\", fix our retention, and skyrocket the growth), we needed to integrate deeply into their operations and provide the smoothest experience of doing it. We launched the most flexible LinkedIn API on the market, and dozens of webhook options to export HeyReach data anywhere.\n\nInstead of being just a campaign tool from where you can run LinkedIn outreach sequences, we decided to become \"the missing LinkedIn puzzle\" of the agencies' outbound stack, and complete the end-to-end streamlining of their outbound processes.",

Trust your team, trust your gut, and just move.\n- Growth takes time. The stories about super-fast growth are exceptions, and you shouldn't fall into the imposter syndrome. It took us 6 months, and 597 meetings to grow above $10K MRR. It's a marathon, not a sprint.\n\n‚Ä¢ Niche down to grow\n- Check my last posts - talked a lot about this.\n\n‚Ä¢ Focus on profitability, control your growth\n- Forget about GaaC (growth at all costs). It's sexy and looks great, but it's super easy to burn everything you have during these times.\n\n‚Ä¢ We can do anything, we cannot do everything (at once)\n- Pick your battles. Most likely, your business feels like a \"leaky bucket\", and there are a gazillion problems you need to solve, features to add, bugs to fix, and directions to go in. Prioritize everything, take a snapshot of your tasks for that month/quarter, and just execute. Repeat this every month/quarter.\n\n‚Ä¢ Customer-centric development is the way to go\n- Your short-term roadmap should be built by your customers & closed-lost deals.

The psychological background is that on LinkedIn you're replying to a person who has a profile picture, works somewhere, posts stuff on their profile, has interests, and most importantly - you decided to add/accept them in your network. On email you are just talking with an email address that maybe has a signature.\n\nüí´ In the end, the core of sales is \"personal relationships\" - buying and selling to people, and the next best thing to in-person relationship building is LinkedIn.\n\nPS: IMO, if you can manage to be \"known\" to the prospect you're reaching out to (i.e. they've seen your content, they know about your company, etc.) your overall outreach can perform much much better, regardless of the outreach channel. Content-led sales FTW! ü§ò",

A precious thing üíé for a founder - right?\n\nOne of our newest & gonna-become-a-go-to-campaign at HeyReach is auto-connecting with our free trial users, and reaching out to them. This campaign has brought amazing results so far and has doubled out fully-activated to converted rate.\n\nüîó Acceptance rate: 64.1%\nüí¨ Reply rate: 25.3%\n\nYou can do the same thing for your SaaS, and I'll show you how we do it.\n\nüî∞ Step-by-step:\n1. Upload your list of free trials in HeyReach\n- Nikola Siljanoski adds the new free trial users in HeyReach every morning, into a list we call \"Free Trial Signups\". If you don't have their LinkedIn profiles, feel free to reach out to Rahul Lakhaney with Enrich.so to understand how to convert their email addresses to a LinkedIn profile.\n\n2. Automated HeyReach sequence\n- We start by sending an automated blank connection request. So, the free trial user gets a connection request from the founder of the tool they'd just started a free trial. Pretty nice, huh?\nThen, after 4 days (enough time to play around with the tool), we send a simple automated message that says:\n‚û°Ô∏è \"Hey hey {firstName}, tnx for accepting me! How's your HeyReach experience so far?\".\n\nAnd that's it. A simple conversation-starter that helps me get in touch with our customers.\n\n3. Talk to your free trial users\n- Most of the users you reach out to reply back, and your only job here is to listen to their feedback and help them if they are stuck somewhere in their activation journey.\n\nüìà This approach has doubled our activated to converted rate, and has helped me talk to our potential users.\n\nCheck the comments for a link to the blog post, where I showcase the whole sequence! üçª\n",

Think of it as a mini-PMF, or a single ICP (ideal customer persona) where you can kill it.\n\nüìê Our formula for niching down to the right audience:\n1. Just ship it, and reach out to your ‚Äòfirst hypothetical ICP‚Äô \n- Just launch your first version of your product and start reaching out to your ICP. Keep in mind that your first hypothesis of the ICP may be completely missed, but don‚Äôt feel bad about it. Just iterate until you find it (you have time until you burn out the money).\n\n2. Talk to the closed-won and closed-lost customers. All. The. Time. \n- This is a continuous process that should help you determine what‚Äôs the right initial ICP (your niche). Keep attention to the deals you‚Äôve lost, the deals you‚Äôve won, the users that churned, and the users that are still with you. Ask them ‚Äòwhy‚Äô, and ALWAYS try to truly understand them (their job position, their role, how they are thinking, how they found you, etc.). Be super specific in the details.\n\n3. Your closed-lost deals should build your short-term roadmap \n- This is applicable only after you‚Äôve found your niche. Start tracking the reasons for losing deals (features, pricing, bugs, etc.), as those things will be your short-term product roadmap. Do this until you become the go-to solution in your niche.\n\n4. Become the go-to solution for your niche, and then expand \n- Stay focused on your niche until you dominate it. Build the features they need, improve their experience, and get that sweet market share. However, don‚Äôt feel too comfy, as you shouldn‚Äôt stop here. As Jason M. Lemkin says, the most important job of the CEO is to continuously expand the TAM, year by year. üí•",

        "text": "'Growth at all costs' mindset may kill your startup üíÄ\n\nBack in the days (2020-2023), the typical advice you'd hear as a VC-backed startup was \"spend more\". The main approach was to be maniacally focused on growth and grabbing a bigger market share. The founders were acting like hungry hyenas pouring money into everything that brings growth, overhiring, overspending, and doubling down on untested channels that might bring growth. \n\nGrowth, growth, growth! (in Steve Ballmer's \"developers, developers, developers\" voice) üå±\n\nIn the last couple of months, I've seen a lot of startups going down because of this mentality. \n\nHowever, the 'growth' is not the problem. The uncontrolled growth and constant stepping on the gas pedal without a working engine is. \n\nIt's really easy to get into this GAAC (Growth at all costs) mindset before even remotely figuring out, be blinded by the Silicon Valley stories about raising hundreds of millions in Series A, and hope that VC money will always be here to save your company when the things go south. \nIf you don't figure it out fast, if you don't have control over the direction you are going, and if you are not obsessed with building a real business the chances of failing are pretty high nowadays.\n\nIn June 2023, we were 3 months away from bankruptcy, burning $35-40K per month. It was a wake-up call for us. \n\nüîπ Lesson learned: Keep it lean until you are pretty positive that you know what you are doing, and you have a pretty good feeling and data informing you that you are ready to scale, burn, and double down on growth.\n\n2024 is the year of predictable and controlled growth with a focus on profitability.

        "text": "Time for a #datastory: In the last newsletter, Kaya Yurieff published how \"Linktree Jumps Into Social Commerce\" and here are three reasons why that makes a TON of sense.\n\n1Ô∏è‚É£ Linktree's Market Cap\n\nIn the first picture, you have Linktree's market cap compared to other link-in-bio tools from 2021 until now. \n\nNotice how the funding of many competitors didn't phase Linktree at all. There are a few companies that grew like Beacons, Milkshake etc, but not at the cost of Linktree users.  * We analyzed 71 link in bio tools but are displaying only the top 10. \n\nWhat this means is that Linktree is still the #1 tool and their word-of-mouth growth is as strong as ever.  \n\n2Ô∏è‚É£ Instagram's poor adoption of the multiple links in bio feature\n\nInstagram added the option for creators to add multiple links in their bios. TechCrunch published an article stating how Meta takes on Linktree, Beacons etc. \n\nWell, that didn't turn out that well. \n\nThe number of creators who use that feature is ~.02% from the sample of creators we analyzed vs Linktree links at ~12.5%. So you don't have to do the math, that's 62,400%¬†more in favor of Linktree.\n\n3Ô∏è‚É£ Social Commerce Happening Inside Linktree Already\n\nThis is probably the main one, there are 13.7% of our sample creators linking to either LTK, ShopMy, or Amazon inside their Linktree link vs only 0.6% who have those 3 as their main link in bio. \n\nThat's a solid chunk and as the data shows far more are using social commerce links inside Linktree than just as their main links. So it makes sense that as a company they would definitely try to use this to their advantage.\n\nHow this all plays out I am not sure, but what I am quite sure is that Linktree is not going anywhere, and judging by the data this should be a very good business move for them.\n\nAgain, this is not sponsored by anyone nor do I have something to gain from it. It's just interesting to see how these business moves are supported by data.",

They could be solved by us working our asses off until we proved that we are worth it.\n\nAnd we did.\n\nThen 2021 came.\n\nMoney started raining from everywhere. We spoke to companies that had much less than 0 in revenue and yet raised tens of millions of dollars.\n\nSo we got offers too.\n\n‚ÄúYou are missing out if you are not raising a round now.‚Äù\n‚ÄúMoney is free; you should take it!‚Äù\n‚ÄúThe creator economy will be worth trillions of billions of millions of dollars; get that money now.‚Äù\n\nMostly thanks to Hugo Amsellem and Boris Sokolov (I almost cracked at that point), we put our heads down and focused on the fundamentals again, working tirelessly but keeping the company independent.\n\nWe didn‚Äôt sprint; we ran a marathon. 20% growth, then another 20%, and then another 20%.\n\nThen 2023 happened. A big, big percentage of the companies that raised those millions are going under or selling for peanuts.\n\nAnd influencers.club? Well, we continued with our 20% growth marathon.\n\nNot distracted by shiny things, not letting the market blind us, and focusing only on fundamentals.",

It‚Äôs always been this way.\n\nOver 90% of startups fail because growing a business is hard and not for everyone.\n\nTo end on a positive note, I think this is another sign that the #creatoreconomy is still developing.\n\nThe demand for tools and services to assist these new creator-led businesses will only increase.",

        "text": "How often do you think creator sites get hit with DDoS attacks? \n\nAnswer:\n\nAt least on Fourthwall, we see these occur 1-2 times per day. \n\nI should also note that these aren't even targeted against \"offensive\" creators. They happen to creators that mostly make kids content. \n\nI'm sharing this chart from a few hours ago where we saw:\n - A spike of ~200k requests from a DDoS attack\n - 0 failures on our end\n\nWe've invested a lot in our core infrastructure to handle these without any downtime over the years, especially given the frequency with which these happen. \n\nI mostly think this is due to the asymmetric nature of an attack. You can ruin someone's big launch day by paying ~$100 for a DDoS (and potentially crashing their site if they don't use a platform like Fourthwall that protects you from these). The trolling nature of the internet makes this surprisingly common.\n\nWhen starting Fourthwall, I would have never guessed that we'd have needed to make such an investment in protecting against DDoS. But here we are. And I'm grateful that we can handle these without missing a beat (0 failed requests for today's attack). \n\nWhat do you think? Do you see a similar frequency of attacks in your space?",

Backstory time:\n\nWe‚Äôve long assumed that SEO would be a key lever at Fourthwall. Why?\n¬†- Most creators sites on Fourthwall (like MKBHD) have a ‚ÄúPowered by Fourthwall‚Äù backlink in the footer\n¬†- Therefore our rapid creator growth should rapidly build domain authority\n\nBut we had no idea where to begin. Here's what happened next:\n\n1. Lenny Rachitsky interviewed Ethan Smith on his podcast about SEO. If you haven't listened, it's by far the most information-dense podcast on SEO. I immediately knew we had to work with the Ethan & the Graphite team. (PS - Lenny sells his new book on Fourthwall. You should buy one.)\n2. A few weeks later, I flew to one of Yuriy Timen's amazing founder dinners to meet Ethan (who now co-hosts these)\n3. At the dinner, I asked Ethan a 100+ SEO questions and pitched him on why they should let Fourthwall be one of the first users of Graphite's new self-serve tooling\n\nTwo weeks later, we got started. Five months later, results were booming üìàüìà (huge props to Cosette Libier from our team for owning the execution).\n\nAs a founder, I highly recommend Graphite's new self-serve platform. It immediately 100x'ed our abilities and will become the top SEO tool for teams that are serious about search-based growth the moment it's available to the public.\n\nThankfully, we get to keep our SEO competitive advantage for a bit longer as it's still waitlist only.
